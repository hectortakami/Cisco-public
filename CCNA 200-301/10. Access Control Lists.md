# **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**

_The ACLs secure L3 and L4 by **filtering and identifying (QoS) incoming** and **outgoing** traffic. They filter via comparing **Access Control Entries (ACE)** that can match **packets**, **ports** and **transport protocols (TCP/UDP)** in the routering devices._
```
// Displays detail information of a particular ACL
# show access-list [acl_number | acl_name]

// Displays ACL implementation on inteface
# show ip interface {gigabit | ethernet} {0-X}/{0-X} | include access list
```

1. **Create ACL Rules**
   
   _**The ACE ordering in the ACL matters**, the router will interpret (top -> bottom) all the instructions set and included in the policies lists. **By default the ACE last statement (implicity set)** in every ACL is **deny any any** restricting all undeclared traffic._
    ```
    // Numbered ACL
    (config)#access-list [acl_number] {permit | deny | remark} {protocol} [source_ip_address] [wildcard | host | any] {gt | eq}? [port_number | app_name]? [destination_ip_address] [wildcard | host | any] {qualifier}? [port_number | app_name]?

    // Named ACL
    (config)#ip access-list {standard | extended} [acl_name] 
    (config-std-nacl)# {permit | deny |remark}  {protocol} [ip_address] [wildcard | host | any] {qualifier}? [port_number | app_name]?
    ```
   - **Standard ACL (1-99 & 1300-1999)**: Reference source address only. In standard ACLs the 0.0.0.0 wildcard equal to the "host" keyword is default.

   - **Extended ACL (100-199 & 2000-2699)**: Check for transport protocol, port number and source/destination IP addres.

    **ACL Qualifiers**
   - "**remark**": Adds an entry comment to the ACL
   - "**protocol**": Can be set as **tcp**, **udp**, **icmp**, **ip**, **eigrp**, **ospf** and some others.
   - "**qualifiers**": The way a protocol and port number will match que qualification
     - "**eq**": Match exactly that port number
     - "**lt**": Lower than the port number
     - "**gt**": Greater than the port number
     - "**neq**": All port numbers except the one given
   - "**host**": Keyword that match 0.0.0.0 wildward, aplying the ACL to only one host
   - "**any**": Keyword that match 255.255.255.255 wildcard, aplying the ACL to all subnet hosts

2. **Implement ACL direction (at interface)**
   
   _We can only apply only 1 ACL for each direction flow in the interface (max 2: 1 in and 1 out)_
    ```
    (config)# interface {gigabit | ethernet} {0-X}/{0-X} 
    (config-if)# ip access-group [acl_number |  acl_name] {in | out}
    ```
