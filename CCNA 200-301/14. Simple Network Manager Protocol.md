# **Simple Network Manager Protocol (SNMP)**

_Open standard for network device monitoring. Centralized device management in a **SMNP Manager (Network Management System Server NMS)** that **pull information/variable status (GET)** form other SMNP Agents and collects it in a **Management Information base (MIB)**. The SNMP Agents can also notify the server when a sensor or link went down by **pushing information/variable status (TRAP) into the server**. The actual version is **SMNPv3** that **supports encrypted community strings (password shared along server and agents) and authentication** is the most recommended to implement but can be not supported depending on the device. SNMP monitors network devices by defined variables (interface status, traffic, sensors, etc...) **each trackable variable from an SNMP Agent is called Object Identifier (OID)**. SNMP is part of NMS systems and can provide reports of the network devices._

_**Syslog vs. SNMP**: Even that **both can store logging information**, is that on **Syslog** we **store with more granularity all system reports** and with **SNMP** the **reporting is less detailed** but we can have **PUSH functionality to configure agents** which Syslog can´t do._

**SNMPv2**
_Use SNMPv2 only when SNMPv3 is not supported. The Community Strings travels as plain text._
```
// Optional: Identificate SNMP AGENT to the SNMP MANAGER (recommended)
(config)# snmp-server contact [snmp_agent_identifier]
(config)# snmp-server location [location_description]

// Configure community string & privileges for SNMP AGENTS
(config)# snmp-server community [community_string] [privilege] 
// Privilege types: "ro" = read-only , "rw" = read-write

// Reference the SNMP MANAGER (for each agent)
(config)# snmp-server host [snmp_server_ipv4] [community_string_for_desired_privileges]
(config)# snmp-server enable traps [action_that_tiggered_trap_to_server]
```

**SNMPv3**
_SNMPv3 **encrypts and authenticates** communication between SNMP Manager and it´s Agents. It´s needed to set up **2 types of password**: an **authentication passoword** that will use the agent to verify is itself and a **private password** shared in the communication to allow encrypted privacy in agents communication._
```
(config)# snmp-server group [snmp_group_name] v3 {auth | noauth | priv*}

(config)# snmp-server user [snmp_agent_username] [snmp_group_name] v3 auth {md5 | sha*} [auth_password] priv {3des | aes* | des} [bits_for_encryption] [private_password]
```

_The **credentials for authentication** and **privacy encryption must match** while configuring the SNMP Manager, and it will depend on the software used on server side._
