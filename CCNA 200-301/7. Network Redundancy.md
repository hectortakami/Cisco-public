# **FHRP & Network Redundancy**
_First Hop Redundancy Protocols: Controls **Layer 3 redundancy and failover recovery**. The usage of **Floating Static Routes** via other router is a feasible solution but we will need to do the manual configuration on each route we need to backup. The problem starts when we look at the **access layer (where hosts)** are assigned with certain default gateway, and **if that gateway fails they need to have another entry to send outside traffic.**_

## HSRP
_The **Hot Standby Redundancy Protocol (HSRP)** is a Cisco´s protocol, creates a **Virtual Gateway IP (VIP)** to assign hosts, if any redundancy routers at distribution layer fails the remaining operational router takes over the operation with transparent service for the hosts. Selects an **active** router which will route all the network traffic through them and if it fails the remaining router in **standby** mode will take the ownership to be the active router._


_We can defined the router that can be active by modifying its **priority (default 100)**, if a tie priority happends the **highest IP** wins the active mode. But is **important to set a preemtion for this**, otherwise the interface will be flapping with the ownership._
```
// Displays VIP information & active/standby assignation
# show standby
```
```
// Configure on interface attatched to LAN (gateway) in both routers
(config)# interface range {gigabit | ethernet} {0-X}/{0-X} - {0-X}
(config-if)# ip address [ip_address] [netmask]  // Do the normal configuration as a common gateway
(config-if)# standby [fhrp_id] [vip_address]
(config-if)# standby [fhrp_id] priority [priority]
(config-if)# standby [fhrp_id] preempt  // USE ONLY in the router you want to convert active with HIGHEST PRIORITY
```

 _Another FHRP protocols used are **Virtual Redundancy Router Protocol (VRRP) open standard** and **Cisco´s Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP)**_
