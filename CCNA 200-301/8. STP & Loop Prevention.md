# **STP & Loop Prevention**
_Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) **prevents loops in layer 2**, which cause 3 main problems: **broadcast storms**, **un-stable MAC tables (CAM)** and **multiple frame transmission**._

_STP Terminology_
- **BPDU**: Bridge Processing Data Unit, contains BridgeID information and set all enable ports in a switch to **blocking state (default)** until find out if can forward if no loop was detected **(50 sec to converge)**
- **BridgeID**: Contains **MAC** and **Priority (0-65535) default 32768**
- **Root Bridge**: Elected by lowest BridgeID, **lowest priority or lowest MAC** all of its ports are in forwarding state (**designated state**). 
- **Root Port**: Interfaces from other switches (not Root Bridge) directly conected to the selected Root Bridge. 
- **Blocked Port (blocked/alternated state)**: It´s the port attatched to the **highest BridgeID neighbor** or **highest Port/Interface Number to reach Root Bridge**, doesn´t forward traffic and it´s administrative down to prevent loop.

_STP Versions_
- **802.1D STP**: Use STP for all the VLANs in the LAN, the open standard.
- **802.1W RSTP**: Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol, improve the convergence time but keeps using one STP for all VLANs in the LAN.
- **802.1S MSTP**: Load balance the STP for different VLANs **(up to 16 VLAN instances):**
  - **PVST+**: **Per-VLAN Spanning-tree**, is a Cisco enhancement of 802.1D **(default on Cisco switches)**, and **for each VLAN the traffic assign a blocked port, optimizing the media usage**. The blocking ports are called "alternate" in this protocol.
  - **RPVSP+**: **Rapid Per-VLAN Spanning-tree**, is a Cisco enhancement of 802.1W, **improved PVST+ convergence time** and also separetes VLAN traffic.

_STP Configuration_
```
// Displays the STP information (PVST+ default = ieee)
---------------------------------------------------
Note: The command divides in 3 outputs:
 "Root ID" that must match in all VLAN switch members
 "Bridge ID" that is information about that particular switch
 "Interface Info" shows the port role/status
---------------------------------------------------
# show spanning-tree vlan [vlan-id]

// Display MAC from other connected switches & interfaces
# show mac address-table
```
```
// Manipulate Bridge Priority
(config)# spanning-tree vlan [vlan_id] root {primary | secondary}     // Decrements automatically priority to win Root Bridge or Backup authority
```

_For **switchport access interfaces**, the usage of STP is no needed so we can skip the 50 secs of convergence by **port-fasting frames**_
```
(config)# interface {gigabit | ethernet} {0-X}/{0-X}
(config-if) spanning-tree portfast
(config-if) spanning-tree bpduguard enable
(config-if) spanning-tree guard root // USE ONLY when we don´t want to receive BridgeID challenges to change the actual Root Bridge through the interface

// Enable globally BPDU Guard (highly recommended)
# spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default

// Disables globally STP blocking states (not recommended unless we can garantee no loop in the switch)
# spanning-tree portfast default
```
