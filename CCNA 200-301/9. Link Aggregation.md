# **EtherChannel & Link Aggregation (LAG)**
_EtherChannel bundles multiple physical ports into one logical port to increase the media utilization (in most cases blocked by STP). EtherChannel also **load balance the data flow** across to several **same media type links**. The EtherChannel connection requirements are: **matching mode configuration on both sides (depends on protocol used)**, **speed and duplex**, **access or trunk mode**, **native VLAN**, **allowed VLANs** and access VLAN (if is an access switchport)._

_Note: The **load balancing** of EtherChannel (and in almost every Cisco´s protocol) is **NOT Round Robin**. It means that even if links are aggregated or multiple paths know how to reach a network, the device will select only one to foward data and will switch from paths to send several source packets,**without fragmenting them and send them through all the links** (would break some applications if fragments arrives in different order)_

## LACP
_**Link Agregation Control Protocol (LACP)** is the open standard where both sides negotiate the port channel creation and maintenance. It´s the **preferred method to use**. It´s modes can be set as **active-active**, **active-passive** in both LACP sides._

## PAgP
_**Port Agregation Protocol (PAgP)** is the Cisco´s standard where both sides negotiate the port channel creation and maintenance. It´s modes can be set as **desirable-desirable**, **desirable-auto** in both PAgP sides._

## Static EtherChannel
_The switches **do not negotiate portchannel**, but both sides have to be set in mode **on-on** to come up._
