# **Network Address Translation (NAT)**

_It started when IPv4 became to run out of public addresses registered by the IANA. That was solved by using **private addresses from RFC 1918 in LAN segments** and transalting them via NAT when going out the internet by WAN cannections. **NAT maps statically or dynamically one private IP with a public IP address to allow outside communication**_

```
// Display the inside & outside (local and global) address mapping
# show ip nat translation

// Removes all Dynamic NAT translation bindings in order to allow NAT configuration modifications
# clear ip nat translation *

// Display inside/ouside interfaces and how many packets has been sended & translated
# show ip nat statistics
```
- **Local Addresses:** It´s the actual source & destination IP, from the **sender point of view**. 
- **Global Addresses:** They are the transalted addresses that match the **receiver knowledgement of it´s private destination** & **which public (translated) address sends** the package. 

## Static NAT
_Maps **1-to-1 private and public addresses**. Usualy used for servers which must **accept incoming connections**._
```
// Configure interface connected to the WAN (public address)
(config)# interface {gigabit | ethernet} {0-X}/{0-X} 
(config-if)# ip nat outside

// Configure interface connected to the LAN (private address)
(config)# interface {gigabit | ethernet} {0-X}/{0-X} 
(config-if)# ip nat inside

// Map privat-public addresses
(config)# ip nat inside source static [private_ip_address] [public_ip_address]
```

## Dynamic NAT
_Uses a **pool of public addresses** (similar to DHCP). Is used for **hosts that needs to connect externally to the internet but not receiving incoming connections.** The addressing assignment is set as **FIFO**. The NAT pool must have enough addresses for all hosts in the inside LAN._
```
// Configure interface connected to the WAN (public address)
(config)# interface {gigabit | ethernet} {0-X}/{0-X} 
(config-if)# ip nat outside

// Configure interface connected to the LAN (private address)
(config)# interface {gigabit | ethernet} {0-X}/{0-X} 
(config-if)# ip nat inside

// Set a NAT pool
(config)# ip nat pool [nat_pool_name] [start_public_addresses] [end_public_addresses] netmask [netmask]

// Create an ACL for all INSIDE hosts that will be using the pool addreses
(config)# access-list [acl_number] permit [ip_matching_for_hosts] [wildcard]

// Associate the ACL with the NAT pool
(config)# ip nat inside source list [acl_number] pool [nat_pool_name]
```

## Port Address Translation (PAT)
_Allows a **same public address to be re-used by many hosts**, the problem on Dynamic NAT is that we need the same amount (or more) public and private addreses. We can use a **dynamic pool** in which the **port number of the solicitant hosts will only be tracked once the pool reach the last available public address**. The same public address is used and the router know how to reach the host via it´s **unique port number**._
### Well-known Public Address (NO DHCP)
```
// Configure interface connected to the WAN (public address)
(config)# interface {gigabit | ethernet} {0-X}/{0-X} 
(config-if)# ip nat outside

// Configure interface connected to the LAN (private address)
(config)# interface {gigabit | ethernet} {0-X}/{0-X} 
(config-if)# ip nat inside

// Set a NAT pool
(config)# ip nat pool [nat_pool_name] [start_public_addresses] [end_public_addresses] netmask [netmask]

// Create an ACL for all INSIDE hosts that will be using the public address
(config)# access-list [acl_number] permit [ip_matching_for_hosts] [wildcard]

// Associate the ACL with the PAT OVERLOAD
(config)# ip nat inside source list [acl_number] pool [nat_pool_name] overload 
```
_The `overload` flag on the last command `enable the port usage for PAT`. But is the same configuration as the Dynamic NAT pool & ACL association._

### Dynamic Public Address (DHCP)

```
// Configure interface connected to the WAN (public address) given by a DHCP Server in ISP
(config)# interface {gigabit | ethernet} {0-X}/{0-X} 
(config-if)# ip address dhcp
(config-if)# ip nat outside

// Configure interface connected to the LAN (private address)
(config)# interface {gigabit | ethernet} {0-X}/{0-X} 
(config-if)# ip nat inside

// Create an ACL for all INSIDE hosts that will be using the public address
(config)# access-list [acl_number] permit [ip_matching_for_hosts] [wildcard]

// Associate the ACL with the PAT OVERLOAD
(config)# ip nat inside source list [acl_number] interface [outside_interface] overload
```
_Here we don´t need to create a pool, and we `match the ACL with the DHCP client interface`. Remember to include the `overload` flag on the last command to `enable the port usage for PAT`. _
