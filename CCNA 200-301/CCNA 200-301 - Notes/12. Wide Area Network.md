# **WAN (Wide-Area-Networks)**

_WAN is a **geographically distributed networks that connects multiple LANs**. A MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) connects devices in a larger geograpical area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN (connection between two institutions with different location offices, remaining in the same state)._

## Leased Lines & Satellite

_Private **dedicated physical connection (P2P)** assigned from the ISP to garantee a **higher SLA (over delay & loss traffic)** to organization usage. Has **fixed reserved bandwidth** because it´s not shared with other companies. Commonly used with fiber-optic media through serial interfaces. The satellite share any fiber leased connection attribute including that are the only feasible medium for unreachable geographical areas._

## Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS)

_It´s a dedicated VPN in which the ISP provides the **same network to several companies** in order to communicate them by **sharing the infrastructure (mesh topology) and dividing the traffic**. Exists different SLA depending on the pricing. Every campus of the same company (in different LANs) has access to a **Provider Edge Router (PE)**, that gives them **direct centralized access to the MPLS infrastructure** through several **Customer Edge Routers (CE)** that are multiple points of access (can be departments or subnets) to this centralized PE._

## Point-to-Point Protocol Over Ethernet (PPPoE)

_**Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)**, **Cable** and **Wireless** (ex. 4G) are some of the **less expensive and more commonly used WAN connections** and all of them are part of the PPP suite where the clients can outbound their connection to the ISP infrastructure (internet)._

## WAN Topologies
- **Hub & Spoke | Star Topology:** All WAN access points are **centralized** making it more **simple and secure**. But the links between campus have a **single point of failure with suboptimal traffic flow (more delay)**.
- **Redundant Hub & Spoke:** Keeps the advantages of a simple star topology **increasing the fault of tolerance** in the network at a **higher cost with the same suboptimal traffic flow (more delay)**.
- **Partial Mesh:** The infrastructure **connects any campus to the others in the network**, has an **optimal traffic flow** but with a **more complex infrastructure** and connection cost.
